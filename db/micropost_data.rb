A relationship, whether it is with your parents, friends, love interest, co-workers, acquantancies, or even yourself is what makes our lives meaningful. Each relationship is important and has it's own meaning in our journey of life."

Go to the park. Sit by the river. Lay on the beach. Do something that doesn't involve all these techy device.There is a beautiful world outside."

When we think of the word 'relationship', we are inclined to think of all the different connections we have with other people. However, we often overlook the connection we have with our own self."

Sometimes, we create this entire plan of how we want something to happen and guess what? Nothing goes according to plan. That doesn't mean we shouldn't plan at all in life but, the truth is, tomorrow is a mystery. This is what makes our lives scary and exciting at the same time. Weird combination right?."

Unfortunately, it's become a way of life for some. We all do it or have done it at some point in time. I am guilty of it too. By creating excuses, we are only cheating ourselves."
